# Project Description
For my final project, I am exploring the music industry and how it has changed over the years. More specifically, I want to look at how music industry sales have changed in the past 40 years in terms of types of sales (CDs, streaming, etc). In answering this overarching research question, I also want to explore (1) how the rise of new sale formats has led to the demise of others, and (2) which sales formats will be most popular moving forward.

The music industry has seen drastic change in recent years as a result of the Internet and music streaming platforms such as Spotify and Apple Music. Since the industry is changing so quickly, it is difficult for artists, record labels, and other companies to keep up. The topic I am researching is important to both artists and business executives in the music industry as they must understand the current sales landscape in order to maximize sales and cater to customer's preferences. By understanding which sale formats are most popular now, which ones are on the decline, and which ones will be popular in the future, artists and companies can know where to focus their marketing and distribution resources going forward.

This topic is of interest to me as I'm very passionate about music. Throughout my life, I have witnessed how drastically the way I consume music has changed. Additionally, I am extremely interested in the music industry and would love to work on the business side of the music industry after graduation. By understanding how music industry sales and consumer preferences have changed, I hope I will be able to have a better understanding of where the industry is going.

# Data Sources
The data source I will use to explore my research question is a dataset I found on data.world. This dataset is on music industry sales over the past 40 years and was created by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). According to RIAA, this is the most comprehensive data on U.S. recorded music revenues. This dataset goes all the way back to 1973 and lists format of sale, metric of sale, year of sale, and value of sale. A link to the dataset can be found here: https://data.world/makeovermonday/2020w21-visualizing-40-years-of-music-industry-sales

This dataset contains data on 23 different sales formats, from cassette sales to album sales to on-demand streaming sales. For each format (except a few), the sales value is listed for each year in three different metrics: units sold, revenue at time of sale, and revenue adjusted to present value. The "Value (Actual)" column is displayed in millions for both unit values and revenue values.

# Analysis and Visualizations
In this notebook, I analyze how music industry sales have changed since 1973 in terms of type of sales, as well as and how new sales formats have affected older sales formats. For my analysis, I decided to only work with the revenue adjusted to present value data, as I found it to be the most insightful. I split my analysis roughly into 5 main steps. First, I created bar charts of every sales formats in order to understand how sales of each format have changed since 1973. Second, I created pie charts at different points in time to see how the composition of music sales has changed. Third, I looked at the correlation of different sales formats in the 2000's to understand which formats are correlated and which are anti-correlated. To take this analysis one step further, I conducted linear regression analysis. Lastly, I looked at the growth rates of particular sales formats in 2019 to reveal which formats are increasing in popularity.
