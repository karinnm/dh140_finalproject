# Research Question
For my final project, I want to explore a research question relating to how different states have been affected by the most recent surge in COVID-19. More specifically, I want to look at which states experienced the highest number of hospitalizations from the Omicron variant, and if these high hospitalization rates correlate to low vaccination rates in a given state. This topic is important to me 
an explanation of why it is important to you, why it matters to others, and what is at stake
# Data Sources
The data source I will use to explore this research question is a dataset on COVID-19 hospitalizations in different states released by the US Department of Health & Human Services (HHS). This dataset lists confirmed and suspected COVID-19 admissions per day (per 100k people).
